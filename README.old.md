# new-portfolio
A more modern portfolio for the modern web.

# But this is just your old site again! What gives?
Testing. Testing is why I did this.

Y'see, my old portfolio, on top of being mysteriously held up by unknown mystical forces (read: I don't fully understand the processes involved in deploying changes), was also created in 2019 by Bootcamp Me.

Bootcamp Me had no idea what testing was outside of "run your app, check the console", but in the following years, I've realized just how important writing software tests is.

To gain more experience with software testing, I decided to add software tests to my portfolio. However, because Bootcamp Me didn't understand testing at the time, I either threw out all the testing stuff when I made my portfolio or it wasn't there to begin with (I can't quite remember which). When I went to try and add the necessary components, I realized that my dependencies were all fairly antiquated and wasn't sure which ones would need updating to fit the tests.

And that is why I'm doing this. This is bootstrapped with a newer version of create-react-app, and includes software testing to ensure quality components.
